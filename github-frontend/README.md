RepoMirror Frontend

This folder contains the frontend of RepoMirror. The frontend is responsible for taking user input, sending requests to the backend, and displaying repository analysis results in a clear and simple way.

It is built to focus on usability, clarity, and proper error handling so users can understand repository quality without technical complexity.

What the frontend does?
Takes a public GitHub repository URL from the user
Sends the request to the backend API
