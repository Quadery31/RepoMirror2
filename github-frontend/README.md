# RepoMirror

RepoMirror is a full-stack developer tool that analyzes GitHub repositories to provide actionable feedback on code quality. It uses the GitHub API to scan public repositories and generates a "Developer Profile," which includes a quality score (0-100), an executive summary, and a personalized roadmap for improvement.

The goal of this project is to help developers and students identify missing best practices in their projects—such as lack of documentation, poor file structure, or missing test cases—and fix them to make their portfolios production-ready.
